### THE WORLD OF JMAR ðŸŒŽ
I'm a Computer Science and Economics student at Lafayette College, passionate about technology and its impact on any industry I find myself in. I'm actively seeking internships that allow me to leverage my skills and enthusiasm in either field.

I've always been drawn to technology, from creating video games to developing projects in Python, C++, C#, Java, and web development. One of my proudest achievements was creating a chatbot using Natural Language Processing to support students dealing with mental health challenges.

Beyond my technical skills, I'm known for my outgoing personality and love for learning about different cultures and identities. I believe my curiosity and ability to connect with people will be an asset in any professional setting.

I'm excited about the future and the opportunities it holds. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate or share insights in the tech and economic industries. Feel free to reach outâ€”I'm always up for a good conversation!
